This release will add support for the September 2020 devices, which will be released on the 18th of September: ([#256](https://github.com/devicekit/DeviceKit/pull/256))
- iPad (8th generation)
- Apple Watch Series 6

Device.appleWatchSeries6_44mm

Device.appleWatchSE_40mm
Device.appleWatchSE_44mm
```

Support for iPad Air (4th generation) will be added in a later version since it will be a long time before we know its device identifiers.

## Version 4.0.0

Releasedate: 2020-09-04

```ruby
pod 'DeviceKit', '~> 4.0'
```

This is a v4.0.0 release because of the possibly breaking change of no longer supporting iOS 9. This decision was made because of Xcode 12 no longer supporting iOS 8.

- Dropped support for iOS 8. Lowest supported version is now iOS 9. ([#249](https://github.com/devicekit/DeviceKit/pull/249))
- Updated project settings for Xcode 12. ([#248](https://github.com/devicekit/DeviceKit/pull/248))
